Learning SDL


# Restructuring main.cpp
I'm going to be completely restructing the main.cpp in this file.
 * I intend to make the code more modable so I can implement the tutorials as classes.
 * I will add a parent class for the tutorial classes to inherit from.
 * Main.cpp will initialize and close SDL, as it already does.
 ...
_More to come._
